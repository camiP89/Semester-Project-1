 The website created for Semester Project 1 - Community Science Museum. An engaging, informative, and user friendly website for a new interactive science museum opening in the city.

# Description:

This project involves designing and developing a responsive, user-friendly, and visually engaging website for the newly established Community Science Museum, aimed at children aged 7â€“15 and families with young children. The goal of the site is to inform and excite the public about the museum, encourage visits, and showcase its interactive exhibits and educational events.

The website is a static site built using HTML and CSS, with an emphasis on accessibility, mobile responsiveness, clean semantic structure, and adherence to WCAG accessibility guidelines. It is designed to be fast-loading, visually appealing to the target audience, and optimized for SEO.
